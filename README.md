Hi, This is my first project with the odin project and my first time using git hub, command line and html in a project setting! I know i will look back on this as if I was crazy for finding this difficult. Lets do this! PS I dont know markdown formatting nor do I care to look it up right now.

Also credit to the original recipes I used and to upsplash for the images:<br>
