    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>2 cups granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup powdered sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer, beat the cocoa, granulated sugar, and butter (or oil) on medium speed. Reduce the speed to low and add the eggs one at a time, mixing until combined.</li>
        <li>Mix in the remaining ingredients in the order listed, except for the powdered sugar. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for 4 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (176°C). Line cookie sheets with parchment paper. Roll the dough into 1-inch balls and coat them with powdered sugar. Place the cookies on the prepared baking sheets, at least 2 inches apart.</li>
        <li>Bake for 10 minutes. Allow the cookies to rest on the hot cookie sheet for 1 minute before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>I use high-quality cocoa powder, like Valrhona, Ghirardelli, or Guittard, for a rich, fudgy flavor. Avoid Dutch-process cocoa, as it may alter the taste.</li>
        <li>To get the cookies extra white with powdered sugar, I coat each dough ball generously before baking. This thick layer ensures the powdered sugar won&apos;t absorb during bake time, keeping the cookies bright and giving them that perfect cracked appearance.</li>
        <li>Chilling the dough in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours helps firm it up, making it easier to roll into balls and ensures a better crack in the cookies.</li>
        <li>I let them cool on the baking sheet for 1 minute before transferring to a wire rack. This prevents them from breaking apart and helps them set properly.</li>
    </ul>
