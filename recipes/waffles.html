    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups milk &#40;I used 2%&#41;</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter &#40;melted&#41;</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat waffle iron. Spray with non-stick cooking spray right before pouring batter inside.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine flour, white sugar, baking powder, and salt. Use the back of a spoon to create a well in the center. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, whisk together eggs and milk. Add in butter and vanilla bean paste/extract and whisk to combine.</li>
        <li>Pour wet ingredients into the well of the flour mixture and whisk until blended. Be careful not to overmix, as the batter should be lumpy.</li>
        <li>Scoop the batter into the preheated waffle iron and cook until waffles are golden brown and slightly crispy. Repeat with rest of batter. Serve immediately or refrigerate or freeze until ready to serve.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Leftover waffles will keep in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.</li>
        <li>To reheat: While a microwave will work for reheating, you will lose some of that crispy texture. To keep your waffles crisp, reheat in a 300℉ oven until waffles are warmed.</li>
        <li>To freeze: store leftover waffles in a freezer-safe container or bag for up to three months. When ready to eat, let thaw completely in the refrigerator.</li>
    </ul>
