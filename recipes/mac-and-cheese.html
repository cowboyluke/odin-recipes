    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta until al dente according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly, until it forms a smooth paste (roux).</li>
        <li>Gradually pour in the milk while whisking to prevent lumps. Continue cooking and stirring for about 5-7 minutes, or until the sauce thickens.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low and stir in Dijon mustard, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Gradually add the cheddar, mozzarella (or Gruyère), and Parmesan, stirring until the cheese melts into a smooth sauce.</li>
        <li>Remove the sauce from heat and fold in the cooked pasta until evenly coated.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F &#40;190°C&#41;. Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Transfer the mac and cheese mixture into the dish, spreading it out evenly.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix the breadcrumbs with melted butter and Parmesan &#40;if using&#41;. Sprinkle the mixture evenly over the mac and cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the topping is golden and the sauce is bubbly. For extra crispiness, broil for 1-2 minutes at the end (watch closely to avoid burning).</li>
        <li>Let the mac and cheese cool for a few minutes before serving. Garnish with chopped parsley if desired.</li>
    </ol>

        <li>Assemble the mac and cheese up to a day in advance, refrigerate, and bake just before serving.</li>
    </ul>
